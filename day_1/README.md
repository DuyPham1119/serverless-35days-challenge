# Part 1: Introduction to Serverless Computing
A cloud computing model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers

#### Keys points:

* No server managerment: Developers don't need to worry about server maintenance, updates, or scaling.
* Pay-per-user: You're only charged for the exact amount of resources used to run your code.
* Auto-scaling: The platform automatically scales to handle varying workloads.
* Event-driven:  Functions are typically triggered by events, such as HTTP requests or database changes.
* Stateless: Each function execution is independent, with no built-in state management.
* Short-lived: Functions are designed for quick execution and then terminated.

#### Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) vs Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS):

| _ | Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) |  Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) |
| :---         |     :---:      |          ---: |
| Execution model | Runs individual functions in response to events     | Provides a complete backend environment    |
| Granularity    | Fine-grained, focused on single-purpose functions       | Coarse-grained, offering full application backends      |
| Scaling    |  Automatic, per-function scaling       | Handled by the provider, but may require configuration      |
| Pricing    | Pay per execution and resources used       | Often based on usage tiers or resources consumed      |
| Statelessness    | Functions are typically stateless       | Can manage state and provide databases      |
| Use cases    | Microservices, event-driven processing, API backends       | Mobile apps, web applications, rapid prototyping      |
| Examples    | AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions       | Firebase, Parse, AWS Amplify      |

#### Considerations:

* Infrastructure management: Cloud provider handles all infrastructure management.
* Scalability: Serverless platforms automatically scale resources up or down based on demand.
* Cost: Can be more cost-effective for applications with variable or unpredictable workloads but may become expensive for high-volume
* Vendor lock-in: Risk of becoming dependent on a specific cloud provider's serverless platform.
* Cold starts: Delay that occurs when a function is invoked after being idle.

### Microservices Architecture

#### Definition:

* An architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled, independently deployable services.
* Each service is focused on a specific business capability.

#### Advantages:

* Scalability: Services can be scaled independently based on demand.
* Flexibility: Easier to adopt new technologies and update individual components.
* Fault isolation: Issues in one service are contained and don't affect others.
* Easier maintenance: Smaller codebases are easier to understand and maintain.

#### Challenges:

* Increased complexity in system design and management.
* Potential performance overhead due to network communication.
* Data consistency across services can be challenging.
* Testing and debugging can be more complex.


### Event-Driven Architecture

#### Definition:

* A design paradigm in which the flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions, sensor outputs, or messages from other programs.


#### Key characteristics:

* Loose coupling: Components interact indirectly through events.
* Asynchronous communication: Events are often processed asynchronously.
* Scalability: Can easily scale by adding more producers or consumers.
* Flexibility: Easy to add new event types and handlers.

#### Advantages:

* Responsiveness: Systems can react quickly to changes.
* Extensibility: Easy to add new features without modifying existing ones.
* Scalability: Components can be scaled independently.
* Decoupling: Reduces dependencies between components.

#### Challenges:

* Event Ordering and Consistency: Ensuring the correct order of events and maintaining data consistency can be problematic, especially in distributed systems.
* Debugging complexity: Asynchronous nature makes tracing and reproducing issues difficult.
* Event storms: Risk of cascading events overwhelming the system.
* Event versioning: Managing changes in event structures over time.
* Error handling: Complexities in managing failed events and implementing reliable retries.
* Monitoring challenges: Traditional monitoring may be insufficient for event flows.
* Initial complexity: Requires more upfront design and infrastructure setup.
* Potential latency: Asynchronous processing may introduce delays in some scenarios.
